#The server source can be found at https://github.com/oskarGrr/chessServer if you want
#to build it and set up your own server. The server uses a lot of win32 api calls, so it
#will only work on windows.

#If you accidentally modify this file, and need a new one you can delete it
#and a new one will be genertated when you start the application again.

#by default this will be the loopback IP. Change it to your server's IP and port.
